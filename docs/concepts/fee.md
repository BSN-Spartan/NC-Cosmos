# Fee

In the Spartan Network, chain accounts pay fees, namely [Gas](#gas), with [Gas Credits](#gas-credit), which the NTT account can recharge with [Non-Tradable Token](#ntt).

## Gas

Gas refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on Non-Crypto Public Chains. Gas is typically consumed whenever read and writes are made to the store, but it can also be consumed if expensive computation needs to be done. 

## Gas Credit

A digital credit on the Non-Crypto Public Chain is used to pay Gas fees. The function is similar to cryptocurrencies of typical public chains, but the credit cannot be traded or transferred between Chain Accounts. Credits can only be recharged and purchased using NTTs in the Virtual Data Center owner's NTT account.

## NTT

Non-Tradable Token is a digital token issued on the Governance Chain (A specific Non-Crypto Public Chain in the Spartan Network). Each Spartan Virtual Data Center can only have one registered NTT account. This account can hold NTT and can only acquire NTT using fiat currency, accepted stablecoin currency, or via the Spartan Networkâ€™s incentive mechanism. The NTT account can be used to recharge the Gas Credits of the chain account of any Non-Crypto Public Chain in the Spartan Network. NTT transactions or transfers between data centers are not allowed.
